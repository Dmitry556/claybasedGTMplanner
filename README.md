# VeoGrowth GTM Generator v2

AI-powered GTM strategy and campaign generator that creates complete go-to-market plans in 60 seconds.

## New Architecture

This version uses Clay.com for AI processing instead of direct API calls:

1. User submits form â†’ Vercel sends to Clay webhook
2. Clay processes with AI models (Gemini for research, Claude for strategy)
3. Clay sends results back to Vercel webhook
4. User sees results on beautiful tabbed interface

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGO_DEV_API_KEY=your_logo_dev_api_key (optional)
   ```

4. Update Clay webhook URL in `app/api/submit-to-clay/route.js` with your actual Clay webhook

5. In Clay, configure your webhook to:
   - Receive: job_id, email, website, positioning_clear, callback_url
   - Process with your AI workflow
   - Send back to callback_url: job_id, research_output, gtm_plan, campaigns

6. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
